# com.unity.addressables.android

This package allows the developer to pack Addressable Groups into Android Asset Packs and this way to take full advantage of Asset Packs based dynamic delivery. Also when Texture Compression Targeting support is turned on for the project this package uses the same settings to pack different texture compression variants to Android Asset Packs.
